# Program: ouiarchive.pl
# Purpose: Grab latest copy of OUI.TXT from the IEEE website and store it in a directory named after the current date.
#	   Also converts the text file into a comma-seperated value file.
#          The lack of perl modules is deliberate, to keep the code more portable.
# Updated: 2012-09-15 - Added lots of debugging code for completeness. Script now detects if file already exists for
#	   current date. Also compares downloaded OUI.TXT to last downloaded copy and only keeps new download
#	   if they differ. This will just save some space and keep things neat.
# Updated: 2013-01-29 - Just a few formatting tweaks and comments, nothing significant.
# Updated: 2013-04-18 - Fixed bug where checking for last directory in kb/ just grabbed the last file entry.
#          It now explicitly makes a list of directories, not files. May still mis-fire though so need to look
#          into using a more specific naming schema. Also added some more error checking.
# Updated: 2017-07-17 - Back-ported fix for "reboot" of Deepmac codebase. Addresses the change in IEEE files having
#	   CRLF terminators. Files downloaded are now run through dos2unix.
