deepmac
=======

The DeepMac project is an attempt to archive indefinitely all OUI records and provide additional metadata related to OUI registrations. Data can be used by IT professionals for asset management and by security professionals for recon and assessment.

The code here is a long-term work-in-progress, with a focus on data and results over code quality, maintainability or efficiency. So no whinies, ;)
Original project started in 2008 and has moved slowly. A full redesign is in progress that focuses on a better way to record metadata about OUI registrations. Future features will allow for search engines that can find new metadata to add to the journals. See below for code overview.

Try and get all requirements together and functioning. Create a MySQL database to hold the original project data. You can initialize it using the dictionary files as a guide, or do a full import of the most recently available SQL dump.
Once a DB has been created and initialized, set-up credentials for it. A set of creds for read/write access to be used by the perl scripts for data loading or manual manipulation, and a read-only set to be used by the PHP search interface.
Add a file named "creds.txt" with the username and password to use for updating the DB. Format is a single line with "username	password" (tab whitespace).
Run and test the various perl scripts to make sure they execute and function correctly. You will need to fix hard-coded paths, put in the correct hostname for the DB backend, etc.
Establish cron jobs to run daily to perform the necessary archiving and updated tasks. Here's an example crontab:

	# Archive IEEE files
	00 01 * * *     ~USERDIR/deepmac/ouiarchive.pl >> ~USERDIR/archive.log
	15 01 * * *     ~USERDIR/deepmac/reboot/ouiarchive.pl >> ~USERDIR/deepmac/reboot/archive.log

	# Generate a master CSV files of dates associated with OUIs based on the archive
	00 02 * * *     ~USERDIR/deepmac/gen-ouidates.pl > ~USERDIR/deepmac/kb/oui-dates.csv

	# Run a database load, using the archive of IEEE OUI files
	00 03 * * *     ~USERDIR/deepmac/dbload.pl >> ~USERDIR/dbload.log

	# Generate some stats from the database for public consumption
	00 04 * * *     ~USERDIR/deepmac/stats.pl > ~USERDIR/deepmac/stats.txt

For the search interface, the PHP code will need to be executable by your webserver, so make sure you put together an appropriate and secure configuration. Deepmac has always used Apache on Linux but on a shared hosting provider.
Test the search interface to make sure it can access the DB and produce results.
