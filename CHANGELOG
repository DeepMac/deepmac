2019-06-13
	- Added a changelog!
	  (Note: You can find summaries of changes in both scripts in the comments at the top)
	- Updated to use most recent fixes from May 2019 for some long sought-after bugs with importing
	  IEEE source files into the journal.
	- Some misc. bug fixes for changes in IEEE distribution of registry files (location, format, etc)
	- verify() function in deepmac_record_class.py no longer fails on blank orgnames
	- deepmac_import.py now does case-insensitive comparisons between records in the journal. This
	  eliminates logging of trivial changes from the IEEE source.
