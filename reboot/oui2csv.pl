# Program: oui2csv.pl
# Purpose: Take a file in the standard OUI.TXT format as distributed by IEEE, and output the data in a tabbed format
#          with one entry per line. Can't use commas as separators, but tsv just doesn't convey the purpose.
# Updated: 2013-04-17 - Fixed issue that cropped up when oui.txt changed slightly. OUI is now extracted via regex.
# Updated: 2014-01-18 - Revised to work with new kinds of OUI files (28 and 36 bit versions), where a range is given
#			in the file. Range value is now extracted and given in output
# Updated: 2014-11-03 - Fixed bug where leading/trailing whtiespace of extracted data wasn't always eliminated properly.
# Updated: 2014-11-30 - Updated so output line is converted to UTF-8 format before printing
# Updated: 2014-12-01 - Fixed bug with initial UTF-8 output (skipped entries in processed file)
